Game rules:
Welcome to the thrilling world of Snake! In this game, you'll embark on an epic adventure as a snake. Your goal? To grow bigger and stronger by gobbling up tasty treats and avoiding your own tail and the treacherous walls that surround you.
As you slither through the pixelated landscape, keep these rules in mind:

Rule 1: Devour Treats üçé
Your snake has an insatiable appetite for apples (A). These delectable treats will randomly appear on the board, and it's your job to guide your snake to them. Every time you devour an apple, your snake will grow longer and longer, making your victory even sweeter.

Rule 2: Mind Your Tail üêç
Beware! Your own tail is your worst enemy. If you accidentally collide with any part of your elongating snake body, it's game over for you. The longer your snake grows, the more challenging it becomes to navigate without accidentally biting your own tail. So stay vigilant and plan your moves wisely!

Rule 3: Avoid Walls üß±
The game arena is surrounded by solid walls. Crashing your snake into these barriers is a definite no-no. You must skillfully maneuver your snake through the ever-narrowing gaps as the walls close in. Don't let them trap you! Be agile and flex those reflexes to survive.

Rule 4: Speed and Precision ‚ö°Ô∏è
Snake, like life, moves fast! You'll need lightning-fast reflexes to guide your snake around the obstacles and towards victory. Be precise in your movements, as a single wrong turn can cost you dearly. Stay focused, react swiftly, and become one with your slithery alter ego. Depending on which level you choose, the pace of the game will be faster.

Rule 5: High Score Glory üèÜ
The ultimate aim of the game is to achieve the highest score possible. Each apple you devour increases your score by 100 points, showcasing your mastery of the game.Can you become the ultimate Snake champion?
Remember, Snake is a test of strategy, reflexes, and determination. So,eat your way to victory, embark on this thrilling adventure,and let the world witness the rise of a legendary snake master!
Now, go forth and conquer the Snake game! üêçüçé
